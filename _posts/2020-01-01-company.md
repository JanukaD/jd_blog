<h2> As an Organization: </h2>

New data-driven businesses are mushrooming, organizations across industries are embracing technological 
advancements, and cybercriminals are getting more sophisticated. Cybercrime rates are growing, and with 
further growth of such crimes expected. With that in mind it is prominent that you enroll in a bug bounty 
platform either as an organization or a hacker. 
 
An organization that has sensitive information to guard and no internal staff to find security bugs (vulnerabilities), 
they can use Bug Zero to hire InfoSec professionals and only pay for what they find.

For organizations, Bug Zero provides;

<ul>
<li> Security testing for no upfront capital investment. </li>
<li> Security testing for no staffing or fixed budget constraints. </li>
<li> A diverse set of eyes on your system with zero recruitment or other logistical overhead. </li>
<li> Increased visibility and transparency for your system. </li>
