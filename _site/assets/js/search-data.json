A Strong Password is defined as a password that is reasonably difficult to guess in a short period of time either through human guessing or the use of specialized software. When coming up with passwords to various accounts, there are standards and best practices to follow so that your accounts are best protected. . Use a strong unique password. . Use a minimum of 08 characters in your password. The longer your password, it will give you better security. | String together 4 random words. Example: correctwhalebatterystable | . | Use a different password for each site you log into. This ensures that if another site is breached or your password is leaked somewhere, it can’t be used to log into another site. | Avoid: Using single dictionary words, spatial patterns (i.e. qwerty, asdf), repeating letters, or sequences (i.e. abcd, 1234). | Making the first letter an uppercase. | Substituting letters with common numbers and symbols. | Using years, dates, zip codes. | . | . Use a password manager. . Password management tools are helpful in storing and organizing your passwords so that you don’t have to memorize all of your unique passwords. Many enable you to sync your passphrases across multiple devices and can help you log in automatically. These password managers encrypt your password library with a master password that becomes the only thing you just need to remember. .",

    "title": "Private vs Public Programs",
    "content": "Private vs Public Programs . There are 2 types of programs you can hack on: private and public programs. . Private Programs . Private programs are programs that aren’t published to the public. This means that you can only submit vulnerabilities to these programs when you receive specific invitations to hack on them. All vulnerability reports for these programs remain confidential and you can’t explicitly talk about the vulnerabilities you find. . As private programs limit the number of hackers invited to the program, the number of report submissions is also limited to enable the program to get the hang of receiving and triaging vulnerability reports. All programs begin as private, but as they become more proficient in handling reports, they can choose to go public if desired. . The advantage of hacking on a private program versus a public one, is that the pool of hackers finding vulnerabilities is much smaller, giving you an advantage to find and be rewarded for vulnerabilities. . Public Programs . When programs become public, they open themselves up to report submissions from the entire hacker community. This means that all hackers on Bug Zero are given rights to hack the program. If you’re a hacker that’s just getting started on Bug Zero and haven’t received any private invitations yet, hacking on public programs are a great way to build up your Bug Zero Points level. .",

Just the Docs uses lunr.js to add a client-side search interface powered by a JSON index that Jekyll generates. All search results are shown in an auto-complete style interface (there is no search results page). By default, all generated HTML pages are indexed using the following data points: . Page title | Page content | Page URL | . Set up search . Generate search index . Before you can use search, you must initialize the feature by running this rake command that comes with just-the-docs: . $ bundle exec just-the-docs rake search:init . This command creates the search-data.json file that Jekyll uses to create your search index. Alternatively, you can create the file manually in the assets/js/ directory of your Jekyll site with this content: . {% raw %} { {% assign comma = false %} {% for page in site.html_pages %}{% if page.search_exclude != true %}{% if comma == true%},{% endif %}&quot;{{ forloop.index0 }}&quot;: { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;{{ page.title | replace: &#39;&amp;amp;&#39;, &#39;&amp;&#39; }}&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;{{ page.content | markdownify | replace: &#39;&lt;/h&#39;, &#39; . &lt;/h&#39; | replace: &#39;&lt;hr&#39;, &#39; . &lt;hr&#39; | replace: &#39;&lt;/p&#39;, &#39; . &lt;/p&#39; | replace: &#39;&lt;/ul&#39;, &#39; . &lt;/ul&#39; | replace: &#39;&lt;/tr&#39;, &#39; . &lt;/tr&#39; | replace: &#39;&lt;/li&#39;, &#39; | &lt;/li&#39; | replace: &#39;&lt;/td&#39;, &#39; | &lt;/td&#39; | strip_html | escape_once | remove: &#39;&#39; | remove: &#39;&#39; | remove: &#39;&#39; | replace: &#39; &#39;, &#39; &#39; | replace: &#39; . &#39;, &#39; . &#39; | replace: &#39; . &#39;, &#39; . &#39; | normalize_whitespace }}&quot;, &quot;url&quot;: &quot;{{ page.url | absolute_url }}&quot;, &quot;relUrl&quot;: &quot;{{ page.url }}&quot; }{% assign comma = true %} {% endif %}{% endfor %} }{% endraw %} . Note: If you don’t run this rake command or create this file manually, search will not work (or it will use the search index data from this docs site, not your site’s content). . Enable search in configuration . In your site’s _config.yml, enable search: . # Enable or disable the site search search_enabled: true . The default is for hyphens to separate tokens in search terms: gem-based is equivalent to gem based, matching either word. To allow search for hyphenated words: . # Set the search token separator search_tokenizer_separator: /[ s/]+/ . Hiding pages from search . Sometimes you might have a page that you don’t want to be indexed for the search nor to show up in search results, e.g, a 404 page. To exclude a page from search, add the search_exclude: true parameter to the page’s YAML front matter: . Example . layout: default title: Page not found nav_exclude: true search_exclude: true .",
