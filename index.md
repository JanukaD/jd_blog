## Getting started

### Who are we?

We, at Bug Zero provide end to end support for every bug bounty programs.

If you are a hacker and want to learn more about the security vulnerability ecosystem, we provide 
a platform to learn security by testing real-world systems while earning money for 
security bugs you find. We also provide essential security training materials to help 
become a renowned infosec professional.

If you are an organization that has sensitive information to guard and no internal 
staff to find security bugs (vulnerabilities), you can use Bug Zero to hire infosec 
professionals and only pay for what they find.
